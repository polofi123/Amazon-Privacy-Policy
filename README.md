# rivacy-Policy
_Last updated: 2025-07-30_

**Polofi** (“we”, “our”, “us”) provides an automation service that connects **Amazon Selling Partner API (SP-API)** to the workflow engine **n8n**.  
This policy describes what data we collect, how we use it, how long we keep it, and the choices you have.

---

## 1. Data We Collect

| Category | Examples | Source | Legal Basis |
|----------|----------|--------|-------------|
| **Amazon catalog & offer data** | ASIN, Buy Box price, fee estimates | SP-API endpoints like `getItemOffersBatch`, `getMyFeesEstimate` | Contractual necessity :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1} |
| **Seller account identifiers** | Seller ID, Marketplace ID | Provided during OAuth consent (Login with Amazon) | Contractual necessity |
| **Operational logs** | API timestamps, success/error codes | Generated by n8n at runtime | Legitimate interest |
| **(Optional) PII** | Buyer name, address (only if you enable order endpoints) | SP-API restricted data token endpoints | Explicit consent / legal obligation |

> We do not collect payment card data, Alexa or Dash information, or Fire‑TV analytics.

## 2. How We Use Your Data

1. **Profitability analytics** – matching Buy Box pricing to your cost data to surface profitable items.
2. **Alerts & reporting** – optional Slack or email notifications configured via n8n.
3. **Compliance auditing** – minimal logging to demonstrate adherence to Amazon’s SP‑API Data Protection Policy. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

We never sell or rent your data to third parties.

---

## 3. Data Retention

* **Amazon PII** (if ever collected) is automatically purged **within 30 days of order delivery**, in accordance with Amazon’s policy. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  
* Non-PII catalog data (e.g. prices, fees) is stored up to **12 months** for trend reporting, then aggregated or deleted.
* System logs are retained for **90 days** for troubleshooting and audit purposes.

---

## 4. Security

* Secrets are stored securely using n8n’s **encrypted credential vault**. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  
* Data at rest is encrypted using AES‑256; data in transit is always sent over TLS.  
* In the event of a breach, affected users and regulators will be notified within 72 hours, per applicable GDPR standards.

## 5. International Transfers

Our infrastructure is hosted in the **United States**, and if you access the service from outside the U.S., your data may be transferred and processed there under **Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs)**.

---

## 6. Your Rights

Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have the right to:

* Access, correct, or delete your personal data (GDPR Articles 15–17).
* Opt out of “sale” or sharing of personal information (CCPA §1798.120).
